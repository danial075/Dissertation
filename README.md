# Glasgow on the go: visualsing urban mobility in Glasgow

## Dissertation 
I will be developing a web application that will visualise urban mobility in Glasgow. I am going to do this by fetching JSON data through the Glasgow open data hub API’s. The data will show information on Glasgow’s traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians. I am planning on representing the data in a visually appealing way whilst also making it easy to analyse for a user.
